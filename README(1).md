# ITrash
A collaborative project made to detect flying projectile trash, track nd predict its trajectory and then move accordingly to catch it.
This project was initially designed and developed in the University of Waterloo's SE101 course with a group of 4 developers.
The ITrash uses Python, OpenCV, Arduino and Rasperry Pi components.
